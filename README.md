# Robustness evaluation and Adaptation of ImageNet models

This repo contains a growing collection of helper functions, tools and methods for robustness evaluation and adaptation of ImageNet scale models.
The focus is on simple methods that work at scale.

We currently have the following features available:
- [`examples/batchnorm`](/examples/batchnorm): A reference implementation of batch norm adaptation used by Schneider, Rusak *et al.* (NeurIPS 2020)
- [`examples/selflearning`](/examples/selflearning): A reference implementation of self learning with robust pseudo labeling used by Rusak, Schneider *et al.* (arxiv 2021)
- [`examples/imagenet_d`](/examples/imagenet_d): Example runs on the ImageNet-D dataset used by Rusak, Schneider *et al.* (arxiv 2021)

Planned features for future releases are (please open an issue if you can think of additional interesting parts to add):
- Helper functions for robustness datasets like ImageNet-A, ImageNet-R and ImageNet-C
- [`examples/clip`](/examples/clip): Robustness evaluation for [CLIP](https://github.com/openai/CLIP.git), Radford *et al.* (2021)
- [`examples/dino`](/examples/dino): Robustness evaluation for [DINO](https://github.com/facebookresearch/dino), Caron *et al.* (2021)

## â˜• The `robusta` toolbox for **Robust**ness and **A**daptation

### Motivation

Besides reference implementations, this repo is mainly intended to provide a quick and easy way to adapt your own code.
In particular, when developing new methods for improving robustness on deep learning models, we find it interesting to report results after *adapting* your model to the test datasets. This paints a more holistic image of model robustness: Some people might be interested in ad-hoc model performance, other might be interested in the performance obtained in a transductive inference setting.

Note that the package is not intended for general purpose domain adaptation. Instead, we focus on providing simple methods that prove to be effective for ImageNet scale model adaptation at test time. The package provides helper functions that are "minimally invasive" and can easily be added to existing source code for model evaluation.


### Quick Start

You can install the package by running

```bash
pip install robusta
```

Depending on your system setup, it can make sense to first manually install the correct `torch` and `torchvision`
versions as described on the [PyTorch website](https://pytorch.org).

Here is an example for how to use `robusta` for batchnorm adaptation & robust pseudo-labeling.

``` python
    model = torchvision.models.resnet50(pretrained=True)

    # We provide implementations for ImageNet-val, ImageNetC, ImageNetR,
    # ImageNetA and ImageNetD:
    val_dataset = robusta.datasets.imagenetc.ImageNetC(
        root=dataset_folder, corruption="gaussian_blur", severity=1,
        transform=transforms.Compose([transforms.ToTensor()])
        )
    val_loader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(
        val_dataset, batch_size=batch_size, shuffle=True)

    # We offer different options for batch norm adaptation;
    # alternatives are "ema", "batch_wise_prior", ...
    robusta.batchnorm.adapt(model, adapt_type="batch_wise")

    # The accuracy metric can be specific to the dataset:
    # For example, ImageNet-R requires remapping into 200 classes.
    accuracy_metric = val_dataset.accuracy

    # You can also easily use self-learning in your model.
    # Self-learning adaptation can be combined with batch norm adaptation, example:
    parameters = robusta.selflearning.adapt(model, adapt_type="affine")
    optimizer = torch.optim.SGD(parameters, lr=1e-3)

    # You can choose from a set of adaptation losses (GCE, Entropy, ...)
    rpl_loss = robusta.selflearning.GeneralizedCrossEntropy(q=0.8)

    acc1_sum, acc5_sum, num_samples = 0., 0., 0.
    for epoch in range(num_epochs):
        predictions = []
        for images, targets in val_loader:

            logits = model(images)
            predictions = logits.argmax(dim=1)

            # Predictions are optional. If you do not specify them,
            # they will be computed within the loss function.
            loss = rpl_loss(logits, predictions)

            # When using self-learning, you need to add an additional optimizer
            # step in your evaluation loop.
            optimizer.zero_grad()
            loss.backward()
            optimizer.step()

            acc1_sum, acc5_sum += accuracy_metric(predictions, targets, topk=(1,5))
            num_samples += len(targets)
            print(f"Top-1: {acc1_sum/num_samples}, Top-5: {acc5_sum/num_samples}")
```


## Example Implementations

### Batch Norm Adaptation

[![PWC](https://img.shields.io/endpoint.svg?url=https://paperswithcode.com/badge/improving-robustness-against-common/unsupervised-domain-adaptation-on-imagenet-c)](https://paperswithcode.com/sota/unsupervised-domain-adaptation-on-imagenet-c?p=improving-robustness-against-common)
[![PWC](https://img.shields.io/endpoint.svg?url=https://paperswithcode.com/badge/improving-robustness-against-common/unsupervised-domain-adaptation-on-imagenet-r)](https://paperswithcode.com/sota/unsupervised-domain-adaptation-on-imagenet-r?p=improving-robustness-against-common)

[[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.16971.pdf)] [[Web](https://domainadaptation.org/batchnorm)] [[README](examples/batchnorm/README.md)] [[Implementation](batchnorm/src/evaluate.py)]

We propose to go beyond the assumption of a single sample from the target domain when evaluating robustness. Re-computing BatchNorm statistics is a simple baseline algorithm for improving the corruption error up to 14% points over a wide range of models, when access to more than a single sample is possible.

### Self-Learning

[[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.12928)] [[Web](https://domainadaptation.org/selflearing)] [[README](examples/selflearning/README.md)] [[Implementation](selflearning/gce.py)]

Test-time adaptation with self-learning improves robustness of large-scale computer vision models on ImageNet-C, -R, and -A.

*Note: The current version of this code base is a work in progress. We still decided to do this pre-release since the core methods are conceptually easy to use in your own code (batch norm adaptation, self-learning, ... and the current state might already be a useful place to start.*
